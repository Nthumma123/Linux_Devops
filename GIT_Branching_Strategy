#Branching Strategy
------------------

Master/Main branch--> we create a new Branch --featurev1, featurev2---merge to Main--and then Delete
Good Branching strategy---calc application ?

New feature to existing code---given to other developers with branch name -featurexyz ---once testing is done ---merge req --Master

feature1, feature2,feature3------------------> eventually added back to master branch

Release branches ?
------------------

To deliver to Customers --we have done complete testing in feature branch
we create a release branch  from master and deliver to customer 

Master branch is for ACTIVE development.

HOTFIX branch?
Some prod bug fix issue ---1/2 days fix the code---> deliver to master and release branch and ship code with release branch to customer.
